class Query:
    """A wrapper for a SQLAlchemy query that knows how to transform result rows
    into data IDs and dataset references.

    A `Query` should almost always be constructed directly by a call to
    `QueryBuilder.finish`; direct construction will make it difficult to be
    able to maintain invariants between arguments (see the documentation for
    `QueryColumns` for more information).

    Parameters
    ----------
    sql : `sqlalchemy.sql.FromClause`
        A complete SELECT query, including at least SELECT, FROM, and WHERE
        clauses.
    summary : `QuerySummary`
        Struct that organizes the dimensions involved in the query.
    columns : `QueryColumns`
        Columns that are referenced in the query in any clause.
    collections : `CollectionsManager`,
        Manager object for collection tables.

    Notes
    -----
    SQLAlchemy is used in the public interface of `Query` rather than just its
    implementation simply because avoiding this would entail writing wrappers
    for the `sqlalchemy.engine.RowProxy` and `sqlalchemy.engine.ResultProxy`
    classes that are themselves generic wrappers for lower-level Python DBAPI
    classes.  Another layer would entail another set of computational
    overheads, but the only reason we would seriously consider not using
    SQLAlchemy here in the future would be to reduce computational overheads.

        To get the expected results from a query, the returned predicate *must*
        be used to ignore rows for which it returns `False`; this permits the
        `QueryBuilder` implementation to move logic from the database to Python
        without changing the public interface.

        Parameters
        ----------
        region : `sphgeom.Region`, optional
            A region that any result-row regions must overlap in order for the
            predicate to return `True`.  If not provided, this will be the
